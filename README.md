# Pathfinding-Project
This is a tool that helps users understand and picture various pathfinding and maze generation algorithms by illustrating these algorithms step-by-step. 

The implemented algorithms include: Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Bidirectional BFS, Prim's Maze Generation Algorithm, and a Recursive Division Maze Generation Algorithm.
